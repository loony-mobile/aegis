AES-256-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard with 256-bit keys in Galois/Counter Mode) is a widely used encryption algorithm that provides both confidentiality and integrity. It's particularly favored for its security and efficiency.

### Key Features:

1. **Strong Security**:

   - Uses a 256-bit key, which is the maximum key length in the AES family, making it highly secure against brute-force attacks.

2. **Authenticated Encryption**:

   - Combines encryption and authentication, ensuring both data confidentiality and integrity.
   - Provides an authentication tag to detect tampering.

3. **Performance**:

   - GCM mode is highly optimized for modern processors and can encrypt and authenticate data in parallel, making it faster than some other modes.

4. **Nonce Requirement**:
   - Requires a unique nonce (number used once) for each encryption operation with the same key.
   - Nonce reuse can compromise security.

### Example Use Case in Cryptography Libraries

#### Node.js (using `crypto` module):

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

const key = crypto.randomBytes(32); // 256-bit key
const iv = crypto.randomBytes(12); // 96-bit IV (recommended for GCM)

const encrypt = plainText => {
  const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-256-gcm', key, iv);
  const encrypted = Buffer.concat([
    cipher.update(plainText, 'utf8'),
    cipher.final(),
  ]);
  const authTag = cipher.getAuthTag();
  return {encrypted, authTag};
};

const decrypt = (encrypted, authTag) => {
  const decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv('aes-256-gcm', key, iv);
  decipher.setAuthTag(authTag);
  const decrypted = Buffer.concat([
    decipher.update(encrypted),
    decipher.final(),
  ]);
  return decrypted.toString('utf8');
};

const message = 'Hello, AES-256-GCM!';
const {encrypted, authTag} = encrypt(message);
console.log('Encrypted:', encrypted.toString('hex'));

const decrypted = decrypt(encrypted, authTag);
console.log('Decrypted:', decrypted);
```

#### Rust (using `aes-gcm` crate):

```rust
use aes_gcm::{Aes256Gcm, Key, Nonce}; // Or another mode of AES-GCM
use aes_gcm::aead::{Aead, KeyInit};

fn main() {
    let key = Key::from_slice(b"an example very very secret key.");
    let cipher = Aes256Gcm::new(key);

    let nonce = Nonce::from_slice(b"unique nonce"); // 12-byte unique nonce
    let plaintext = b"Hello, AES-256-GCM!";

    // Encrypt
    let ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(nonce, plaintext.as_ref())
        .expect("encryption failure!");
    println!("Encrypted: {:?}", ciphertext);

    // Decrypt
    let decrypted = cipher.decrypt(nonce, ciphertext.as_ref())
        .expect("decryption failure!");
    println!("Decrypted: {:?}", String::from_utf8(decrypted).unwrap());
}
```

### Common Pitfalls:

1. **Nonce Reuse**:
   - Never reuse a nonce with the same key, as it compromises security.
2. **Tag Verification**:
   - Always verify the authentication tag before trusting the decrypted data.
3. **Key Management**:
   - Properly manage and secure keys to avoid unauthorized access.
